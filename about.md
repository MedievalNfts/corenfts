**Accurately represents your app's identity:** The NFT-Tracker App is an AddOn for Google Sheet, where you can track your Solana NFTs, receive alerts if the NFT is at a price-level which could be set in the sheet. 
Furthermore it is possible that the current floorprices of the NFT-Collection is refreshed in a specified intervall, which can be set in the settings.

**What will this app do with user data?** The App does nothing with the user data. If a email-address is set in the settings for price alerts it will send an email to this address. Furthermore it asks for permissions to connect to external requests which is needed for the Solana-Prices and to receive Data from MagicEden (Royalties and Floorprice) to determine the value of the portfolio.
Data is not stored. All Data is in the sheet which is stored in the Drive of the own user.

**How does this app enhance user functionality?** This App reads data from NFT-Collections from Magic-Eden and Solana-Prices in EUR and USD. 
This is needed for calculation of profit and/or loss of each collection to build a sum of the portfolio.
Furthermore it is possible to set some price-targets (e.g. Take Profit or Stop-Loss) if the option is set the user will receive an notification via email to the set adress. Sender is the own email-address where the app is used.

**Describe the content, context, or connection to the app:** The App is an Add-On for Google Sheets. It sets data to different sheets / cells. The best user-experience is, if the add-on is used within a template. The Intention is to give the user a overview of all the NFTs of Solana which is in the portfolio and to give some notifications.

The App askes for some restricted scopes, that are needed to get data from external resources (in that case from YahooFinance and MagicEden). 
Furthermore to send Emails in the own name, which is needed to send the price notifications. 
Also for the automatic update of the floorprices and for sending notifcations even if the sheet is not opened it asks for the scope to run in the background. 
At last it asks for the scope to edit the sheets that are stored in the account of the user to set the data to the sheet.
