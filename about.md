# CORE

**By CORE:** As implied deliberately by the name, Core can be a noun, verb, or adjective, but is most often used as a noun to refer to the central or most important part of something (“the core of the issue,” “the Earth’s core”) or to the usually inedible central part of a fruit (“an apple core”). And with the CORE application, which will be available on both the apple store and the google play store. The CORE application is built to serve as the bridge between Art and the evolved Digital services by serving as a platform where artists, digital artist's, cookectors and Cryptocurrency enthusiasts can access dapps beneficial to the specific service required.

**What will this app do with user data?** The CORE App does nothing with the user data. If an email-address is set in the settings for price alerts it will send an email to this address. Furthermore it asks for permissions to connect to external requests which is needed for the Polygon-Prices and to receive Data from Opensea (Royalties and Floorprices) to determine the value of the portfolio.
Data is not stored. All Data is in the sheet which is stored in the Drive of the own user.

**How does this app enhance user functionality?** The CORE App reads data from your linked Medieval NFT-Collections from Opensea and polygon-Prices in EUR and USD. 
This is needed for calculation of profit and/or loss of each collection to build a sum of the portfolio.
Furthermore it is possible to set some price-targets (e.g. Take Profit or Stop-Loss) if the option is set the user will receive an notification via email to the set adress. Sender is the own email-address where the app is used.

**Describe the content, context, or connection to the app:** The App is an Add-On for Google Sheets. It sets data to different sheets / cells. The best user-experience is, if the add-on is used within a template. The Intention is to give the user a overview of all the NFTs of Solana which is in the portfolio and to give some notifications.


## Google OAuth2 Limited Use Disclosure 
The App askes for some restricted scopes, that are needed to get data from external resources (in that case from YahooFinance and MagicEden). 
Furthermore to send Emails in the own name, which is needed to send the price notifications. 
Also for the automatic update of the floorprices and for sending notifcations even if the sheet is not opened it asks for the scope to run in the background. 
At last it asks for the scope to edit the sheets that are stored in the account of the user to set the data to the sheet. 
The Add-Ons use of information received from Google APIs are adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy) including the Limited use requirements.
